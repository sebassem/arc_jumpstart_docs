## Markdown linting and style guidelines

To uphold the professional presentation and readability of our content, it is imperative that all scenarios and README files should adhere to standard markdown and linting rules. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Utilize standard markdown:** Ensure that your content follows the standard markdown syntax, guaranteeing uniformity and ease of understanding for our readers.

2. **Editor recommendation:** We recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your editing needs. VS Code offers a robust Integrated Development Environment (IDE) experience, augmented by its support for extensions tailored to markdown editing.

3. **Markdown linting:** Before submitting a pull request (PR) for a new or updated scenario, conduct thorough markdown linting. This process helps identify and rectify errors, ensuring the accuracy and professionalism of our documentation. If you opt for VS Code as your editor, we strongly advise installing the [_markdownlint_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) extension. This extension streamlines the linting process, enabling efficient and effective identification of markdown-related issues and typos.

### Markdown linting example and resolution guidelines

To help ensure error-free documentation, familiarize yourself with common issues that may arise while writing your scenario and how they are resolved. Here we explain the markdown rules flagged by the linting extension, along with step-by-step instructions on rectifying violations.

1. **Heading structure:** Ensure proper hierarchy in your headings. Markdownlint may highlight inconsistencies in heading levels. To resolve this, adjust the number of hash symbols (#) to match the desired heading level.

2. **Link formatting:** Markdownlint detects malformed or broken links. Verify that your links are correctly formatted, including both the square brackets for the link text and the parentheses for the URL. Fix any broken links by providing the correct URL.

3. **List formatting:** Maintain consistent list indentation and bullet point styles. Markdownlint helps identify misaligned or improperly formatted lists. To resolve this, align list items correctly and ensure consistent bullet points or numbers.

4. **Code block indentation:** Markdownlint ensures code blocks are correctly indented. If your code blocks are flagged, adjust the indentation to match the surrounding text. This enhances code readability and presentation.

5. **Image syntax:** If you include images, Markdownlint checks the syntax. Ensure that image links are correctly formatted, enclosing the alt text in square brackets and the image URL in parentheses. Correct any syntax errors to display images properly.

Below is an example showing common issues you may see while writing your scenario. [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.VSCode-markdownlint), you can find detailed explanations of the markdown rules highlighted by the extension and how to fix a violation of these rules.

## Screenshot quality and standards

Exceptional quality, accuracy, and cleanliness in screenshots are paramount for delivering an outstanding Jumpstart scenario and reader experience. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Clarity and precision:** Ensure screenshots are clear, sharp, and accurately represent the content they illustrate. High-resolution images enhance visibility and comprehension for our readers.

2. **Relevance and context:** Capture screenshots that directly relate to the scenario's steps and provide essential context. Irrelevant or extraneous visuals can confuse readers and dilute the instructional value.

3. **Consistency in appearance:** Maintain a consistent visual style across all screenshots within a document. Consistency enhances the professional appearance of our scenarios and fosters a cohesive reading experience.

4. **Annotations and highlights:** When necessary, use annotations or highlights to draw attention to specific elements within the screenshot. Arrows, circles, or textual callouts can guide readers' focus and emphasize crucial details.

5. **Editing documentation:** As a crucial step in the process, ensure that screenshots are seamlessly integrated into the documentation. Pay attention to formatting, alignment, and captions to create a polished and cohesive visual narrative.

6. **Resolution and format:** Opt for commonly used image formats like PNG or JPEG and ensure an appropriate resolution. Images that are too large may slow down the document's loading time, so strike a balance between quality and file size.

7. **Accessibility:** Consider readers with visual impairments. If using annotations, provide alternative descriptions for screen readers to ensure accessibility for all users.

### Screenshot formatting

- Screenshots must be saved in _png_ file format.

- Highlight borders and arrows must be used in a non-freeform fashion. Choose a color and line width that make sense (contrast-wise) so it will be embedded nicely in the screenshot.

- Be aware of sensitive information (i.e. subscription id, passwords, service principals, etc.) in your screenshots and be sure to blur/mask it out.

- For Azure portal related screenshots, we recommend using the ["Az Mask"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/az-mask/amobeamdmdnloajcaiomgegpakjdiacm) browser extension.

## Code blocks and commands formatting

In Jumpstart, code blocks and commands play a pivotal role in conveying technical information accurately. To ensure adherence to markdown rules and maintain our scenario standards, it is imperative that each code block and command utilize the correct markdown language highlighter.

1. **Markdown language highlighter:** Choose the appropriate markdown language highlighter for each code block and command. Markdown supports a wide array of programming languages and scripting formats. By specifying the correct language highlighter, you enable syntax highlighting, improving the readability and comprehension of the code.

2. **Consistency across scenarios:** Maintain consistency in markdown language highlighters across all scenarios. Consistent formatting creates a seamless reading experience for users navigating various scenarios.

3. **Command line inputs:** When presenting command-line inputs, use the appropriate shell language highlighter (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) to accurately represent the command syntax. Properly formatted command examples ensure that users can replicate the steps without encountering unexpected errors.

4. **Editing and review:** During the editing and review process, pay close attention to code block formatting. Reviewers and contributors should collaborate to confirm that the correct language highlighter is applied to each code snippet and command, refining the content for accuracy and consistency.

## Managing credentials, secrets, and passwords

The importance of safeguarding credentials, secrets, and passwords cannot be overstated. When crafting code and guides for our scenarios, utmost care must be taken to protect sensitive information. Here are essential guidelines to ensure the secure handling of such data:

1. **Masking sensitive information:** Whether it's a credential included in the code or a secret/password displayed as part of terminal output, it is imperative to mask these details from the reader. Masking ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and inaccessible to unauthorized individuals.

2. **Environment variables:** Encourage the use of environment variables for storing sensitive information. By employing environment variables, credentials and secrets can be securely managed outside the codebase, reducing the risk of accidental exposure in version control systems.

3. **Encryption and hashing:** Whenever feasible, advocate for encryption and hashing techniques to secure sensitive data. Encrypting passwords and sensitive configuration files adds an extra layer of protection, making it more difficult for malicious entities to access the stored information..

4. **Educational context:** If it is necessary to demonstrate specific operations involving credentials or secrets for educational purposes, clearly highlight that the displayed information is for instructional use only and should be replaced with appropriate values in a real-world scenario.

5. **Regular review:** During the review process, pay meticulous attention to any code that involves sensitive information. Reviewers and contributors should collaborate to confirm that sensitive details are appropriately masked and secured, ensuring that the scenario content meets our stringent security standards.

Thank you for your vigilance in safeguarding credentials, secrets, and passwords, enhancing the overall security of our Jumpstart scenarios.
